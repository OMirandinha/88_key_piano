# 88 key piano
I've always been very passionate about music and musical instruments but it seems like every single virtual piano one can find online is misssing several keys, while not all of them are necessary to play most songs it can be frustrating to not have the option available. <br>
I aim  to change that through this passion project, it'll be a virtual piano application with all 88 keys + some other QOL features, it may take a long time to push everything out of the door but it's something I've been meaning to develop for a long time now so no need to worry about it being abandoned.
